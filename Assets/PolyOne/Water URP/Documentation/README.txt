# Realistic Water – URP Shader

Realistic Water is a high-quality water shader designed for the Universal Render Pipeline (URP),
focused on creating natural-looking water surfaces suitable for realistic and semi-realistic games.
It features animated waves, depth-based color blending, and subtle light reflections to enhance
the sense of scale and realism in outdoor environments.

The shader is optimized for real-time applications and works well for lakes, oceans, rivers,
and coastal scenes in both desktop and mobile projects.
